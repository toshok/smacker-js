A Smacker decoder in Javascript
-------------------------------

Just a weekend hack converting the c# decoder in scsharp over to JS.  Doesn't work quite yet.

The only stream type available reads from JS arrays, so you'll need to convert .smk files.

  $ gmcs smk-to-js.cs
  $ mono smk-to-js.exe blizzard.smk > blizzard.smk.js

and then update this line in smacker-test.html with to point to the .smk.js file

  <script text='text/javascript' src="blizzard.smk.js"></script>

this will generate a potentially huge .js file.  both firefox 3.6 and newer safaris seem to
choke on that large of an array literal.  I've been running things in chrome-stable without
problems, though.
